# Workout
Do you go jogging and record your workout with your Apple Watch or record any workout in any other way? Do you want to have access to recorded data to organise it as you please?
With Workout you can export all your workouts saved inside the Health app to a CSV file and import them to your favorite spreadsheet app and view any detail:
- General data such as distance, duration, heart rate, calories (active and total), average pace and speed
- Minute by minute details for supported workouts:
  - Running & Walking: pace, heart rate, step count
  - Swimming: speed, heart rate, stroke count
- Heart zones for running workouts
- Workout route can be exported to CSV or GPX when available
